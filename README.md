# WeatherNotify
The program informs you about temperature changes in the selected region by sending Windows notifications. Written in Python 3 and only works well on Windows 10 and above. I have already compiled it into an .exe file but you can do it yourself and read the source code. Constructive criticism is welcome. License GPL 3.
